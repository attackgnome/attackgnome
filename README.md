### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a background in geophysics and engineering and am diving into learning what I can about data science and machine learning. 

I'm interested in collaberating on open source projects in python and R.

Feel free to ask me about my experience in the petroleum industry and how I see open source tools being used in that sphere.
